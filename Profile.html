		<h2> Recruitment </h2>
		<p> I worked as a recruiter for several years in Beijing, Qingdao and Shanghai. I found native English teachers and helped them secure jobs
		at schools and universities. I really enjoyed being able to jump into another culture and learn a new language.</p>
		<h2> Operations </h2>
		<p> I have two years experience in internationl operations. I assisted Automotive and other companies with their import operations.
		I learned quite a bit about the legal process for imports and gained a deeper understanding of bonded shipping and tariifs.</p>
		<h2> Development </h2>
		<p>I just started developing. I hope to learn Java and then adding other useful tools like HTML and CSS.
		Take a look at some of my projects so far: </p>
